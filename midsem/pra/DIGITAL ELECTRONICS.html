                A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power. The transistor<br>
                 is one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics. It is composed of semiconductor material, usually<br>
                  with at least three terminals for connection to an electronic circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair<br>
                   of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output)<br> 
                   power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. Some transistors are packaged <br>
                   individually, but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits.
