    <p class="p3"><u>REPORTS AND BUSINESS WRITING</u></p>
    <p class="p3">REPORTS</p>
<p class="p3">REPORTS A report is a structured written document in which a specific issue is examined for the <br>
    purpose of conveying information, in order to report findings, to answer a request, to put forward <br>
    ideas and make recommendations or offer solutions. An effective report is one that is written appropriate <br>
    to its purpose and audience, accurate, logical; clear and concise; and is well organised into clear section<br>
     headings. These sections enable readers to find and focus on specific pieces of information.  <br>
     <br>
    CLASSIFICATION OF REPORTS  Reports can be classified into two basic types:  1.  Oral reports <br> 
    2.  Written reports  <br>
    Written reports have:  1. Informal (short) reports  <br>
    2.  Formal (long) reports  <br>
     
    Examples of Formal Reports 1. Periodic reports (also called Routine reports)  <br>
    2.  Special reports  <br>
    3.  Informative reports  <br>
    4.  Interpretive reports (also called Analytical or Investigative reports) </p>

   <p class="p3"><b><u> CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD BUSINESS REPORT </u></b></p> 
 
    1. Accuracy of facts: Since reports are used for decision-making, inaccurate and unverified facts can lead to disastrous results. Reports are based on facts. 
     
    2. Brevity: Difficult to define, it is also not possible to state it as a rule to be followed for writing reports. Good reports are brief but brevity should not be achieved at the cost of clarity nor should it be at the expense of completeness. Thus the reports should include everything that is relevant yet be brief!  
    2 
     
     
    3. Clarity: Clarity comes from orderly, systematic and clear thinking. Reports should be skillfully divided in to short paragraphs, giving headings and inserting signposts to attract attention and securing sustained interest of the readers who are indeed customers.  4.  Free from grammatical errors  Good reports are a good piece of composition presented attractively and free of any grammatical error. If choice of words is faulty, construction of sentences is confusing and design of paragraphs is dull, reports would find few readers. If reports require too much of sorting out of data and sifting out the meanings before taking decisions, it would always leave a lurking doubt in the decision makers‟ mind. And if decisions do not reflect the conviction of management, they are unlikely to be implemented properly.  
     
    5.  Objectivity of recommendations  Recommendations should be objective and impartial. These must be based on logical conclusions of the investigation, analysis and findings. Self-interest of the individuals should not creep in directly or indirectly.  
     
    6. Unity and Cohesion  If the writers are clear about the main purpose of the report, it gives unity and cohesion to the report  
     
    7. Precision  Reports avoid extraneous issues and are precise and incisive. Precision adds value to the report.  
     
    8. Reader-orientation  Reader orientation is customer orientation. Writers must always keep the person(s) going to read the report in mind. Contents of reports to laypersons will be different from the reports prepared and submitted to experts and specialists.  
     
    9. Relevance  The facts and data should have a direct bearing on the main purpose of the message intended. Nothing relevant should be skipped nor any irrelevant data be added to make 
    3 
     
    the report confusing. Exclusion of facts may make the report incomplete and is likely to mislead.  10.  Simple language  Reports using simple, familiar words and direct construction of sentences call for a greater understanding of the subject. Only a deep knowledge enables persons to throw up and use simple words and phrases for expressions. Reports should be free of trite expressions, clichés and figures of speech.
